          <strong>Vallabhbhai Jhaverbhai Patel</strong> (31 October 1875– 15
          December 1950), popularly known as Sardar Patel, was an Indian
          politician. He served as the first Deputy Prime Minister of India. He
          was an Indian barrister, and a senior leader of the Indian National
          Congress who played a leading role in the country's struggle for
          independence and guided its integration into a united, independent
          nation. In India and elsewhere, he was often called Sardar, meaning
          "chief" in Hindi, Urdu, and Persian. He acted as Home Minister during
          the political integration of India and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.
          Patel's commitment to national integration in the newly independent country earned him the sobriquet "Iron Man of India".
          He is also remembered as the "patron saint of India's civil servants" for playing a pioneering role in establishing the modern All India Services system. 
          The Statue of Unity, the world's tallest statue which was erected by the Indian government at a cost of US$420 million,
           was dedicated to him on 31 October 2018 and is approximately 182 metres (597 ft) in height.

        <h2>Key Moments in the Life of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel</h2>
        <button class="accordion">1928 – Earning the title ‘Sardar’</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <ul>
              <li>It was women of Bardoli who bestowed the title Sardar for the first
                time, which in Gujarati and most Indian languages means Chief or
                Leader.</li>
              <li>The Bardoli Satyagraha in Gujarat is considered a major
                episode of civil disobedience and revolt in the Indian Independence
                Movement.</li>
              <li>After suffering from years of floods and famines, the farmers of the 
                region were facing grave financial difficulties. They petitioned and appealed to 
                the Governor of Bombay Presidency to reduce their taxes but were asked instead to pay 30% more.</li>
              <li>Beingleft with nearly nothing to feed themselves and their families
                after-tax, the farmers now appealed to Vallabhbhai Patel to lead
                them to revolt.</li>
              <li> Patel first reminded them that refusing to pay taxes
                may lead to their lands and property being confiscated and them
                being sent to jail. Prepared for the worst, the farmers of Bardoli
                Taduka stood united and were ready to fight the Government’s
                injustice in a completely non-violent manner, as lead by Patel.</li>
              <li>As the villagers stopped paying their taxes, the British Raj declared
                that they will crush the revolt. Sending in collectors to terrorize
                and forcibly seize property from the villagers, the Government soon
                began to auction lands and houses. But not a single man from Gujarat
                or anywhere from across India came to buy the lands.</li>
              <li>One village did break the unity and paid taxes, so they were ostracized. 
                If someone did buy the confiscated lands, they could no longer find the labor
                to work those lands. When Indian members of the Government in Bombay
                and across India started resigning office and expressed open support
                for the farmers – the Raj had no choice but to agree to the terms of
                the farmers.</li>
              <li> Not only were all confiscated lands restored, but all
                taxes were also waived for the year, with the 30% increase in taxes
                pushed further by another two years.</li>
              <li>While Patel credited Mahatma
                Gandhi's teachings and the farmers' undying resolve for their
                victory, people across India recognized his vital leadership.</li>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>While many leading freedom fighters initially criticized Mahatma
                Gandhi's proposal for an all-out campaign of civil disobedience to
                force the British to quit India, Patel was its most fervent
                supporter.</li>
              <li>Convinced that the British would leave India as they had
                Singapore and Burma, Sardar Patel urgent the campaign to start
                without any delay.</li>
              <li>Knowing the British were in no hurry to leave
                India, he favored an all-out rebellion that would galvanize the
                people of India.</li>
              <li>He argued that such a rebellion would force the
                British to concede that they can no longer continue colonial rule in
                India, and thus speed the transfer of power to Indians.</li>
              <li>Owing to his
                views and actions, Sardar Patel was arrested nearly 10 times between
                1930 and 1945.</li>
              <li> Each time after release, many times in poor health,
                he gave highly charged emotional speeches to large crowds across
                India - asking his countrymen to refuse to pay taxes and to
                participate in civil disobedience, mass protests, and a shutdown of
                all civil services.</li>
              <li><q>Governor of Burma boasts in London that
                they left Burma only after reducing everything to dust. So you
                promise the same thing to India? ... You refer in your radio
                broadcasts and newspapers to the government established in Burma by
                Japan as a puppet government? What sort of government do you have in
                Delhi now?...When France fell before the Nazi onslaught, in the
                midst of total war, Mr. Churchill offered union with England to the
                French. That was indeed a stroke of inspired statesmanship. But when
                it comes to India? Oh no! Constitutional changes in the midst of a
                war? Absolutely unthinkable ... The objective this time is to free
                India before the Japanese can come and be ready to fight them if
                they come. They will round up the leaders, round up all. Then it
                will be the duty of every Indian to put forth his utmost
                effort—within non-violence. No source is to be left untapped; no
                weapon untried. This is going to be the opportunity of a lifetime</q> <strong>-Sardar Patel</strong>

            <li> The problem of the States is so difficult that you alone can solve
              it" – Mahatma Gandhi When the British finally left, they left behind
              India, Pakistan, and over 562 princely states in the territory
              colonized by them over nearly 200 years.</li>
            <li> All princely states were
              given the option of either joining India, Pakistan, or remaining
              independent.</li>
            <li>It was Sardar Patel who convinced 559 of 562 princely
              states to join the Union of India. He did so with pure persuasion
              and statesmanship – a stupendous task achieved without any
              bloodshed, with no parallel in recorded history.</li>
            <li> Only three states;Jammu & Kashmir, Junagadh, and Hyderabad did not willingly merge
              into the Union of India. In Junagadh located in Gujarat, Patel first
              showed force, sending the army to occupy three principalities of
              Junagadh, demanding that the Nawab accedes to India.</li>
            <li>Hyderabad,
              which was the largest of all princely states, also included parts of
              present-day Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Maharashtra at
              the time.</li>
            <li>When the Nizam decided to hold out against India and
              organized attacks on Indian soil, Patel launched Operation Polo –
              forcefully securing and integrating Hyderabad into the Union of
              India in just four days.</li>
